# SVMIntuitionPlotter
Shiny web application for playing around with the math behind Support Vector Machine

## Disclaimer: 
This is a quickly hacked together proof of concept done to experiment with Shiny and plotly. Expect bugs and suboptimal implementations. Suggestions, improvements and bug fixes are welcome.

## Instructions:
Use the mouse to move the blue dot to change the orientation of the axes.
You can set the lambda, margin and intercept using the input boxes. You can toggle the optimal solution for this lambda as found by  [SVMMaj](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/SVMMaj/index.html) package.

## Known bug: 
To ensure everything updates correctly, you first need to move the blue dot.

## Support Vector Machines
TBA: Explanation about Support Vector Machines and how this tool can help understand the math behind them.
